And if you should get tested. So you prevent unknowingly infecting people in your environment.<br><br>Did you get tested, and do you have coronavirus? Together with the GGD, you can warn people who were near you for an extended amount of time. Including people you don't know. In a restaurant, cinema or waiting room, and if those people also used the app.<br><br>Thanks to CoronaMelder we can act quicker and prevent new infections.

Then you won't get a notification later. Yes, the Bluetooth signal was strong because you were near each other. But only for a short time.
